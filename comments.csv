Restoration requires manual repair of image artifacts such as hot pixels present on the camera's imaging sensor, dust on the camera's lens, dirt and micro-meteor damage to the ISS cupola windows. Visuals are enhanced by applying a denoising algorithm, correcting exposure offsets across the time-lapse and adjusting contrast, brightness and color grade.

China,2025-11-27 17:57:20.000+0000,ulic14,"Beijing is awesome. Spend time in the Hutongs(old alleyway houses, great leap brewing has a pub in one that is lovely to spend some time in). I personally found the Summer Palace to be more interesting than the Forbidden City. For the great wall, check out some of the Hostel tours(been years, but Leo hostel ran the one I did in 2010, they pickup from most other hostels), they aren't that expensive and make it easier, especially if you are trying to maximize time. \n\nHaven't been to chongqing in 15 years, but definitely go for hot pot. Line 2 is an elevated monorail, and offers some great cheap views of a lot of the city. \n\nNot sure what your plan is for Chengdu, but if you can make it out to Leshan to see the giant Buddha, it is totally worth it(consider staying the night in Leshan, plenty of cheap Hotels across the river with views of it). \n\nXi'an is definitely worth it if you can squeeze it in. If you do the Terracotta warriors, start with the smallest pit and work your way up to the main one. The Shuyan hostel just to the west of the south gate along the city walls is a nice place to stay and meet other travelers, both local and foreign, and the staff is super helpful. Definitely eat in the Muslim quarter(some of the best food in China), and the main Mosque is actually quite interesting to see. \n\nFor Zhangjiajie, DON'T stay in Zhangjiajie city. Stay in Wulingyuan(the actual name of the park), there are a ton of hotels walking distance from the park enterance. You can get in, do Tianmenshan(half a day or so) , and then take a bus from the bus terminal by the old/slow train station to Wulingyuan. With your time/plan, I'd really reccomend skipping the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon/Glass Bridge, as you are adding 1.5-2 hrs travel round trip to get there and it is rather underwhelming and over touristed in my opinion. If you want to get the most out of the park, take the shuttle to the Elevator and take it up. Depending on how much you want to walk, you can walk from there to the main senic area, or take the shuttle to cut a bit out. Once you are done there, take the shuttle to the Yangjiajie Cable car, and hike down and back through the Golden whip stream(the bottom of the canyon). Make sure to take the side trail out and back to the 'cooridor in the cliffs'(best spot in the park and not many people make it there). It's a full day, and that time of year there is likely to be snow, but I have done it in January and it is breathtaking. If you take a second day in the park, take the Tianzishan Cable car up, explore the area at the top, and hike down through the 10 mile gallery(bad translation, it's not that long). Try something with the 'Tujia Smoked Meat', they are some my favorite dishes in the country. \n\nIn Dali, best thing to do is rent an electric scooter or two and do a loop around the lake, stopping as you see fit(the pagodas, villages in the far side, etc), then spend the night in the old town. There are some really nice hotels between the old town and the mountain that are cheaper/get more bang for your buck.\n\nIn Lijiang, consider staying in either Shuhe or Baisha old towns rather than Lijiang Old Town. They are a bit less overrun with tourists(though Shue was getting there last I went) and still very pretty. In Lijiang old town, look up the bar 'Stone the Crows', good atmosphere and place to meet people. Renting a bike/scooter and exploring the countryside around Lijiang is a good option. \n\nShanghai(lived there for 7 years) is more of an experience town, less of a sightaeeing town. Just wandering or biking around the Former French Concession or the old town can be a lot of fun, and lead you to discover some cool spots. Skip Xintiandi, Tianzifang is better(but packed on weekends). Yuyuan gardens is OK, but not great, and you will probably see better elsewhere, not sure I'd really bother. The Shanghai museum is excellent, but target your galleries, it is massive. Definitely check out the Propaganda Poster Art Center, it's a trip. Consider a daytrip to Suzhou or one of the other small Canal Towns on the edges/just outside the city. The Shanghai Urban Planning museum has an awesome scale model of the whole city. If you want to go up one of the big skyscrapers in Pudong, skip paying for the observation decks and head to one of the hotel bar happy hours instead - roughly the same height, roughly the same price, AND you get a drink. Not as cheap as it used to be, but the Captains Hostel rooftop bar is still cheaper and more laid back than the other rooftop Bund Bars. If you want a one stop nightlife spot with a lot of expats, found 158 (though it is a bit over the top). Senator Saloon has awesome atmosphere and great (mostly bourbon based) cocktails at much more reasonable prices than most places. C's bar is probably one of the best dive bars I've been to period, it's a bit of a maze in the basement of a non-descript building, but it is kinda dead durring the week. \n\nGuangzhou is ok, but by that point doesn't offer much you haven't done/can't do in Hong Kong. If you can't get a direct train to HK, just take one to Luohu in Shenzhen, walk across the border, and hop on the HK Metro. \n\nIn HK, take the ferry across the harbor. Consider a day on Lamma Island if you wanna get away from the crowds. Most of HK other than the island/Kowloon is actually pretty undeveloped, has some good hiking and several long distance trails. There are spots to camp on the beach(with shops/restaurants thst will rent tents and gear, we did it in Ham Tin and Sharp Peak for the sunrise)\n\nFor transit directions, I always used Amap. It's in Chinese, but  you can just find the spot on a map in English(maps.me or OsmAnd are good options, also have tons of trails) then do the same on Amap. Make sure to setup a Pinyin keyboard on your phone(to type chinese characters in roman letters).\n\nWhen booking trains DON'T just book the one with the shortest time between cities, pay attention to what stations are closer to where you want to be. For example, the train from Hongqiao in Shanghai to Nanjing South is 'faster' than the train from Shanghai Main to Nanjing Main, but when you add in getting to/from the stations to the city center and the sights, it is actually a good bit longer time wise.\n\nWhatever you do, stay patient and smiling and you can get through just about any situation. Remember the culture is based on 'face', so if you have issues try to resolve them in a way that still allows the other person to 'win' a bit too, direct confrontation/being combative usually goes poorly, even if they are completely in the wrong.\n\nGood luck, safe travels, and dm if you have any other questions.",0,nr36k9o,2025-11-27 17:56:52.577+0000,t1_nr36k9o,False,/r/China/comments/1p6xja8/1_month_january_china_trip/nr36k9o/,0,1,74d13264-cbba-11f0-8910-92a8b4b661cb

The Japanese or Taiwanese navy are not significant, neither then or now.\n\nAlso the 1996 crisis and the rapid conquering of Iraq by the US forces, triggered an accelerated development of anti ship weapons by China and military development in general.\n\nBecause China was utterly unable to do anything in 1996. \n\nIt's very different now. \n\nUS carriers will most likely not risk getting anywhere close to China. They are too vulnerable.\n\nUS bases around China are also going to hit by rockets although they are hardened targets and should be easy to repair or survive the barrage.\n\nThere are also issues with Chinese rockets (like the fuel being stolen by soldiers for cooking :-) so the barrage will probably not be that large, with many rockets failing to reach their targets.\n\nBut those are further away and planes starting from these bases will be prone to intercepting by Chinese fighters. The US has more fighters but they are spread all over the world, it will take time to concentrate them around China.\n\nSo if it comes to a war, China will probably delay a US response by attacking US bases around China so that they cannot receive planes, munition and personnel for a while.\n\nThey also plan to conquer Taiwan as rapidly as possible so that by the time brings in it's full weight, Taiwan is already conquered and the US doesn't have the equipment to do a counter invasion.\n\nOf course plans rarely survive contact with the enemy but it is what the US has to prepare for. And I don't think they are preparing adequately. \n\nI haven't heard of any exercises that practice redeploying planes rapidly to the East Asian theatre for example.\n\nAnd US navy exercises near China are relatively small and were unable to even detect a Chinese submarine until it surfaced close to a battlegroup... several times in the last decades: https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-submarines-keep-proving-they-could-sink-navy-aircraft-carrier-213505",0,nr1kqkb,2025-11-27 12:24:08.288+0000,t1_nr1kqkb,False,/r/China/comments/1p7dnl0/taiwans_president_lai_lashes_out_against_beijing/nr1kqkb/,0,1,f9286ce6-cb8b-11f0-9320-720d5d77685a

The crux of it is the claim that in the future, China will not want to buy anything from Europe, so Europe and the rest of the world will be forced to go into protectionism. \n\n>On a recent trip to mainland China, I found myself posing the same question, again and again, to the economists, technologists and business leaders who I met with. “Trade is an exchange. You provide something of value to me, and in return, I must offer something of value to you. So what is the product, in the future, that China would like to buy from the rest of the world?\n\n\\- \n\n>This is not a threat but a simple statement of fact. Workers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and the US need jobs.\n\n  \nThe author uses examples like Soybeans and iron ore as examples of things China wants that Europe cannot provide. He forgets that products are only part of the function of trade, and there exist services as well: tourism, financial, travel, and international. In his mind, he does not see, or rather, does not want to see, a world where if China leads, they may treat European nations economically the same way Europe has traditionally treated SE Asian nations like Thailand, Malaysia, or Vietnam. \n\nHe claims Europe has no future in a world where China buys nothing from Europe, while in reality, he's probably more concerned that he doesn't want to see a future where European countries like Spain, France, and Germany exist to provide services for other, more powerful nations. \n\n>Several of the economists, who had perhaps pondered the issue already, jumped ahead to a different point altogether: “This,” they said, “is why you should let Chinese companies set up factories in Europe.”[](https://www.biznews.com/africa/china-pouring-exports-africa)It is a train of thought that gives away the real answer to the question.

I worked in China as an English teacher and had all of the required work/residence permits with a school. A school administrator offered me a side job at her husband’s workplace to teach business English there. All tax-related income was paid to the government for BOTH jobs. In the original bilateral public school work contract, a side job isn’t officially allowed. However, an administrator offered it, most importantly all related taxes were paid for both jobs and I had a valid work permit. I decided not to renew my contract with the public high school. Now, there is a large sum of money via an income tax refund which the government is offering back. \n\nAm I legally able to collect the money in this situation? I'm currently back home in Canada, but am planning on visiting next Springtime. Is there some kind of legal issue involving this situation? Since I no longer work at the school, would any negative consequences from the school be void given the circumstances?

Small gangs of college girls who collectively assemble english questions to quiz you and giggle at every answer and you join their tour group for the day.

A Pakistani Indian restaurant owner in Yangshuo with a herculean level of alcoholism and womanizing that would make Bill Clinton blush comes to mind. His idea of a bar crawl was getting cussed out by ladies of the night in the red light district for past misdeeds and then getting kicked out of each and every bar for getting too drunk. Fun but occasionally scary night. \n\nIf people ask you something you don't understand in Chinese just default to saying \"I LOVE CHINA\" in chinese or I LOVE BEER or I AM FROM ENGLAND.

China,2025-11-26 04:56:32.000+0000,LeagueLogical2783,"As someone who been to both countries and is a former heroin addict (I’ve been sober for 5 years) I see what ur saying but heroin is like pure euphoria. It feels like sex time 10 plus helps u sleep. So I see why drugs like this will always exist the drug I really don’t why people do it is street fentanyl, meth and tranq. \n\nFentanyl if it’s legal and pure I can get partially why people take if it’s medically prescribed but for street use not at all as I had it during surgery feels exactly like heroin just more potent. But my thing is why if ur on heroin would u ever go to a drug that has almost 100% of killing u or overdosing on or if not that your 100% going to have a bad time if ur getting it from the street. On top of that it only last 2 or 3 hours at most, and give u 20 times worst withdrawals than heroin. Like I really do not get it at all.. \n\nNow for meth people say it’s better than sex times 10 which is not true at all I was laced with liquid meth in my drink 10 years ago. And I will tell that shit fucking sucks it’s evil in every way. Makes u look like the undead. And the only benefit I can see from is it makes u work like fast like u drank 20 cups of coffee and u don’t want to stop I’ve seen a an old friend of mine worn 5 days no joke 5 days straight just using that drug… what’s the fun in that, the head high is awful worst feeling I ever had and gives u enormous head ache at the end..\n\nTranq is the one I have no idea why people would want ur already using fentanyl which will make u sleep and most likely overdose unless ur tolerance is through the rough, ur legs and arms and skin and basically ur whole body will rot and stink. U feel like shit walk like a zombie and the only benefit I’ve seen from it is being able to sleep. A person I know who was a heroin user (this is a month before I got clean officially) had it laced in his heroin. And he said it was not only the worst feeling in his life it felt like just from one time using it it was making his skin and body feel like pure shit.. he got clean 6 months after that just bc of that experience.. \n\nFor heroin their was the high it was awesome, for me the reason I used it was bc it was the only drug that got rid of my pain from my 7 herniated disks, it helped me sleep easily, gave u dream like euphoria that made me remeber my best friend who died from fentanyl and the good times we had (in college we didn’t even do drugs together we were just best friends who would hang out everyday) and lastly it lasted a long time. The only negatives were it was hard to get off of as I had to have surgery to get off of it (for my back that is) and that it was fucking so expensive. One gram would be like 80$ to 90$ if u knew how to find it. If u didnt and u were getting of the street in the US. It was anywhere for 300 to 400$ for pure shit like I’m talking pure not even touched shit.. even now from what I’ve heard it’s anywhere from 175$ to 250$ a gram and that’s if h know where to find it. On the street 330$ to 600$ a gram keep in mind and an addict needs atleast 14 to 28 grams a month. Oh lastly if u do shoot it would fuck up ur veins for atleast 3 months to a year if u use heavily  (I never shot it never in my life I was scared of needles always)",0,nqtxg9a,2025-11-26 04:56:08.356+0000,t1_nqtxg9a,False,/r/China/comments/1makle3/what_is_drug_scene_in_yunnan_province_like_in/nqtxg9a/,0,1,391187a6-ca84-11f0-9ce8-0ec6079bd2f1

China,2025-11-26 04:37:20.000+0000,bloomberg,"From Bloomberg reporters Diana Li, Pui Gwen Yeung, and Sangmi Cha: \n\nWhen Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hosted a private banquet for suppliers in Taiwan in May, the room was packed with some of the biggest names in global electronics. The chairmen of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Hon Hai Precision Industry were there, surrounded by a sea of local manufacturing titans. In a group photo to mark the event stood a man — tucked in the back row, wearing a dark shirt — who few would recognize: Chen Tao.\n\nThat unassuming presence belies his growing influence. The 53-year-old former soldier, who once served in China’s Taklamakan Desert, has become one of the country’s richest artificial intelligence billionaires — his fortune built on the world’s insatiable demand for the technology and a critical partnership with Nvidia.\n\nChen is the founder and chairman of Victory Giant Technology Huizhou, which manufactures printed circuit boards (PCBs) — the intricate electronic backbone for the AI servers. As Nvidia’s GPUs became the engines of the AI revolution, Victory Giant, which is based in the city of Huizhou in China’s Guangdong province, to the north of Hong Kong, has emerged as one of its core suppliers.\n\nThe demand has sent Victory Giant stock soaring, making it this year’s top-performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index with gains of more than 530%. While its valuation is 32 times estimated earnings, that’s a fraction of the 100-plus multiples seen by other local chipmakers.\n\nThe surge gives Chen and his wife, Liu Chunlan, a combined net worth of $9.1 billion as of the Nov. 25 close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, vaulting them above the likes of Pershing Square Capital Management founder Bill Ackman and Blackstone’s President Jon Gray.

China,2025-11-26 02:01:36.000+0000,OZsettler,">There are certainly aspects of chinese culture that I have negative thoughts towards outside the ccp. Like the dating scene and dowries. Its not unique to china, but it definitely doesn't help the birthrate situation especially with how much pressure there is in the economy. Like that's not something I can blame the cop on bc it was around before then and requires a cultural shift imo, which is happening in some areas to my knowledge.\n\nThe dating culture is highly affected by CCP. Why? People lack social security due to low social warefare, so they want their potential partners to be as rich as possible. The social warefare in China is very bad for normal Chinese people. No, don't use property owners in Beijing/Shanghai etc. to prove their social security level is high or anything.\n\n>But having been to china recently, I have to say that compared to my country there's definitely serious trade offs and not strictly better, but I still prefer life here. I really miss a lot of the infrastructure in china. Even with the fears of overinvestment, it's still nice to have that rapid transit compared to the state of my city.\n\nThis is because you were not born as Chinese and a lot of restrictions do NOT apply to you. All foreingers more or less have priviledges in China and if I were like that, I can also praise China as much as I could. But for normal Chinese people, again, most of their priviledges don't apply and they will have an extremly hard time if they live like what you do in China, because locals won't give them a free pass by thinking \"okay, they are a foreigner, so it is understandable\". \n\nLike even if you speak broken Mandarin with all tones all over the place, they can still praise you “中文说的不错” - meanwhile having heavy dialect accent in China can make people just ignore you.\n\nThe infrustracture, yeah, I get what you mean - big airports, subways, shopping malls and so on and they are fancy, aren't they? But what about normal Chinese, do every Chinese live in these well maintained morden areas? You are a foreigner, so you are not restricted by a thing called Hukou, do you?\n\nI don't blame you to have your rose glasses on things like this, as you may or may not realise you have priviledges in China.

Subsequent United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 further solidified the international consensus on the One-China principle. The claim that \"Taiwan’s legal status remains unclear\" is inherently false: Taiwan has never possessed the status of a sovereign state.\n* **Legitimacy of the Anti-Secession Law**: China’s enactment of the\xa0*Anti-Secession Law*\xa0is a preventive act of self-defense against \"Taiwan independence\" forces, akin to how any sovereign state would legislate against secessionist activities. By the user’s logic, would the U.S. federal government’s preservation of the Union during the Civil War also constitute \"maintaining law through violence\"?\n\nEquating China’s opposition to \"Taiwan independence\" with \"unequal treaties\" is a deliberate distortion. Unequal treaties were illegal documents imposed by colonizers on sovereign states, whereas the\xa0*Anti-Secession Law*\xa0is domestic legislation enacted by a sovereign state to exercise its right to self-defense—the two are fundamentally distinct in nature.\n\n**Second, the Taiwan issue is fundamentally different from Kosovo or Scotland**\n\n* **The Kosovo Case**: UN Security Council Resolution 1244 explicitly recognizes Kosovo as part of Serbia’s territory. Its unilateral \"independence\" has been recognized by some Western nations but opposed by 90 countries, including China and Russia. This demonstrates that power politics cannot override international law.\n* **The Scotland Referendum**: The referendum was authorized by the U.K. central government under law, constituting an internal matter of a sovereign state. In contrast, Taiwan, as a province of China, has no right to unilaterally determine its sovereignty.\n\nAmong the 193 UN member states, 182 adhere to the One-China principle. So-called \"Western recognition of independence cases\" represent political manipulation by a minority and cannot alter the consensus of international law.",0,nqt06m8,2025-11-26 01:21:00.249+0000,t1_nqt06m8,False,/r/China/comments/1p5pgoa/japans_new_leader_infuriated_beijing_she_isnt/nqt06m8/,0,1,2b37dcde-ca66-11f0-97be-0ec6079bd2f1

Trump had been hinting that he would offer to sell Tomahawks, long-range cruise missiles, to the Ukrainian army. But he did not.\n\n\nWhy not? Perhaps because Ushakov listened to Witkoff’s advice and persuaded Russian President Vladimir Putin to call Trump on October 16. Witkoff, in other words, may have helped block that sale.

That's still a pretty low average population growth and at no point has it got up to where it was in the 60's. The last time the UK's population was actually in decline was in the late 70's and early 80's, which are not generally agreed upon to be the rosiest of times for our country economically.\n\nYou've got to look at these things long term. The rate of growth of the world's population as a whole peaked in 1973 and has been declining steadily ever since. It has gone negative already in most of the developed world once you leave out immigration. At some point, probably during the second half of this century, the world's population is going to peak and begin to decline as that global rate goes negative. At that point, developed countries will be fighting over who gets the immigrants, and we're going to be forced to come up with a new way of organising things that doesn't rely on an ever-expanding working age population to offset the elderly population. The lower we cut immigration numbers, the worse situation we'll be in in twenty or thirty years time; immigrants contribute disproportionately to both our birth rate and to the younger portions of our population pyramid. \n\nThe problem is that we've not built infrastructure sufficient to sustain what has historically been a high-ish but absolutely normal rate of population growth; a rate that, economically speaking, we need.

He's supposed to remember what he did and didn't do forty years ago? Heck, most people don't remember what they had for lunch four days ago. Digging up dirt about that man's teenage years isn't going to do any good. This isn't going to change a thing. The people who disliked him will continue to dislike him, the people who liked him will continue to like him. And a few others (like myself) will be preoccupied with wondering if a functioning society can be built on viewing people's entire lives under the microscope.

Being able to hop around/see a decision tree, or being able to meaningfully fast forward through dialog makes the experience much more enjoyable. I bet the voice acting that's added in later versions is pretty fun as well, though I don't know how well that works with the narrator. You assume all game long that the narrator is the main character's inner voice, but if that's the case, why wouldn't the narrator be spoken by the main character?\n\nBut there's this sense of exploration and adventure that's just missing from later iterations as well. In the original game, there's nothing telling you there's even multiple endings. You just have to find out that's the case on your own by replaying it.\n\nAlso, my understanding is that the final puzzle is changed for the worse as well. In the original game, you're playing a sudoku puzzle. Which, if you're familiar with how sudoku works, isn't all that challenging. But it fit the entire theme so much better than the replacement puzzle they came up with. And personally, as an avid sudoku player, I was beyond hyped when the sudoku puzzle came out. There's no instructions, you're just expected to figure it out. And I literally yelled when it happened.

Everyone in the world is hardened, dangerous or desperate and then Kay walks in acting like she is in a light adventure comedy. It creates a weird disconnect because the story keeps telling you she is in serious trouble but her attitude never reflects that.\n\nIt is not that she is a bad character. Her energy works in small moments, but when every scene has the same joking vibe it makes the stakes feel soft. The underworld in Star Wars is usually gritty and tense. When the protagonist does not react to that tension it pulls you out of the moment.\n\nIf they had given her a bit more emotional range the whole story would land much better.

The game was designed to be intentionally sluggish and slow. That was literally how it was marketed. By definition, it is tedious. You might personally enjoy it, that's where the subjectivity comes in. You are wrong in saying the game is not tedious, it's just personally not tedious for you.\n\nSince I know you probably still won't grasp this concept, I'll give you an analogy.

They are inflicting their subjective will onto the objective universe.\n\nPlayers (Guardians) revive from death because they are immortal undead beings brought back to life by The Traveller’s Ghosts (Sentient robots that link the Guardians to the Traveller) which explains respawning etc. The players throwing themselves off The Tower (In game lobby/social hub) for fun is canon in game, there is a hazard zone around the base of The Tower so civilians don’t get hit by guardians jumping to their deaths. This also explains the PvP modes. They are actual sanctioned arena battles between guardians in universe respawning with their ghosts, the in universe characters view it like a sport, it is broadcast to the public, spectators make bets on outcomes, people support famous teams and are fans of skilled guardians, even weapon manufacturers sponsor guardians/matches with their weapons and gear (Explains where the loot/rewards from the match come from).\n\nThere are many other consistencies between gameplay and lore like this, but these are some of the more obvious ones.

From the declassified war games we've run, apparently it looks pretty bad if we don't strike the mainland (and if we've run wargames involving striking the mainland, they're classified for good reason).  Which makes sense, they're an industrial powerhouse with tons of missiles and we're projected power to the complete opposite side of the world.  He didn't share any classified intel with me.\n\nThe US's strength lies in the fact that we can cripple their infrastructure in the first week of the war using undetectable bombers, and in a fight between standing militaries as of today, we could crush them (as long as they can't rearm, pump out new missiles as the conflict goes on, etc.).  If you just put everything China has into the Taiwan straight and put it up against probably 2-3 CSGs, the only limit will be getting the planes rearmed fast enough.\n\nFor the record, he also said that (1) the US military is essentially 100% focused on China and has been for the entire 8 years he's been in, and that Russia is barely an afterthought, and (2) he feels extremly confident that Takaichi's statements on Taiwan were done in coordination with the Trump administration.

The one POW was gravely injured (I don't think he was a drone operator), and begging to be \"put out of his misery\" and the soldiers were trying to figure out how to get him help, but ultimately they gave the POW what he wished for and shot him. After, the video shows the Russian soldiers asking each other, \"what should we do with the drone fa--ots\" and well, we know what decision they decided to come to.",0,nqymwrt,2025-11-26 22:52:06.337+0000,t1_nqymwrt,False,/r/worldnews/comments/1p7jowz/russian_military_reportedly_executes_5_ukrainian/nqymwrt/,0,1,889c1a84-cb1a-11f0-88f1-f2df124fa497

While FP-1 shows significant effectiveness achieved through years of mass use and improvements, according to General Staff experts, the FP-5 rocket drone still has to go through this path. Currently, it is considered an experimental weapon with great technical characteristics and development potential. However, its improvement is complicated by the high cost per unit and the developer's capabilities. \"If Western technologies were integrated into 'Flamingo,' it would be easier, but so far these are limited efforts by the domestic manufacturer,\" said a General Staff representative.\n\n\n>\"It is too early to demand a final result from this weapon. It exists, it works, and it is being developed in cooperation with combat units — the process is ongoing.

worldnews,2025-11-26 09:14:40.000+0000,UpgradedSiera6666,"This project has been under consideration for several months, in a global security context marked by \"uncertainty\" and \"rising tensions,\" the head of state said on the sidelines of the G20 summit on Saturday.\n\nIn a world \"full of uncertainty,\" with war raging on Europe's doorstep, Emmanuel Macron could announce in the coming days the introduction of voluntary military service in France, a project that has been under consideration for several months. Thursday is being considered as the date for the presidential announcement, although this has not been officially confirmed, according to multiple sources.\n\n\"In the world we live in, with its uncertainties and rising tensions, if we truly want to be safe, we must deter others from coming (...) France must continue to be a strong nation with a strong army, but also with the capacity for collective action,\" said the head of state on Saturday, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa. While the Scandinavian and Baltic countries, neighbors of the Russian giant, have maintained or reinstated compulsory military service in recent years, France suspended conscription in 1997 under President Jacques Chirac.\n\n\"Many of our neighbors in Europe are reintroducing national service,\" said Chief of Staff General Fabien Mandon on France 5 on Saturday, adding that this was one of the \"factors to be considered in our country.\"\n\n\"A new framework for service\"\n\nEmmanuel Macron introduced this idea of voluntary service on July 13, in front of an audience of high-ranking military officers. Faced with a Europe \"endangered\" by the \"ongoing threat\" from Russia, \"we need a nation that is capable of holding its ground and mobilizing,\" he said. In addition to \"efforts on our reserves,\" we must also \"give young people a new framework to serve, in other ways, within our armed forces,\" he emphasized, promising \"decisions in this regard in the fall.\"\n\nWhen questioned by AFP, the Ministry of the Armed Forces declined to comment on the details of this service, its duration, or its cost. Alice Rufo, Minister Delegate for the Armed Forces, simply stated on France Info on Sunday that \"work is underway in this direction.\" \"No decisions have been made,\" a source close to the matter told AFP.\n\nUp to 50,000 young people per year\n\nThe French armed forces have approximately 200,000 active military personnel and 47,000 reservists, and are expected to grow to 210,000 and 80,000 respectively by 2030. The voluntary mobilization of part of an age group could serve to meet the need to \"acquire the mass\" necessary to sustain a conflict over time, according to General Pierre Schill, Chief of Staff of the Army, this summer.\n\nIdea welcomed by politicians\nThe idea has been welcomed by some French politicians. \"Anything that can contribute to the spirit of defense, national resilience, and express the patriotic sentiment that lies dormant in the population is positive,\" commented Cédric Perrin (Les Républicains), chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, in La Tribune on Sunday.\n\nOn the far right, Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally (RN), said on Wednesday on X that he was \"in favor\" of reinstating compulsory military service, \"starting with military service open to volunteers.\"\n\nPatrick Kanner, president of the Socialist group in the Senate, remains more cautious. \"I am very cautious on this issue (...) I believe in a professional army today. However, if young people want to serve their country, I am naturally in favor of that,\" he told France 3 on Sunday.\n\nThe expected decisions also promise to address the uncertain future of universal national service (SNU) for minors aged 15 to 17. This civil service program, launched in 2019 and whose funding has since been cut, never really got off the ground. It consisted mainly of a two-week team-building course.",0,nquqi0g,2025-11-26 09:14:45.862+0000,t1_nquqi0g,False,/r/worldnews/comments/1p738kk/emmanuel_macron_may_announce_in_the_coming_days/nquqi0g/,0,1,5a362788-caa8-11f0-8783-9a062afb9f73
